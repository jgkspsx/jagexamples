Do not forget to define the following environment variables:

export M68KTOOLS=/path/to/m68k-aout-gcc

export JAGPATH=/path/to/Jaguar-tree

It is assumed that Jaguar-tree has a 'bin' subdirectory which contains
- the Atari tools (MadMac, ALN, rdbjag, wdb) 
- the BJL loader (lo)
- the Skunk loader (jcp)

If not, please modify Makefile.config according to your configuration.
