A little example of use of the Removers library.

Do not forget to define the following environment variables:

export JAGPATH=/path/to/Jaguar-tree

It is assumed that Jaguar-tree has a 'bin' subdirectory which contains
- the Atari tools (MadMac, ALN, rdbjag, wdb) 
- the BJL loader (lo)
- the Skunk loader (jcp)
- the Removers Jaguar image converter

If not, please modify Makefile.config according to your configuration.

You may also need ocaml to build some examples from source code.
